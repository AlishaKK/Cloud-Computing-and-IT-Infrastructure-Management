### What is an Operating System (OS)?

**Operating System (OS) :** The core software that manages a computer's hardware and provides a platform for applications to run, making the device usable for users.

**Why We Use an OS:**

* **Enables Hardware Functionality:** The OS tells the physical parts (screen, keyboard, etc.) how to work.
* **Platform for Apps:** It creates the environment needed for software like WhatsApp or web browsers to run.
* **Resource Management:** It efficiently organizes the computer's brain (CPU), memory (RAM), and storage.
* **User Interaction:** It provides the interface (icons, touchscreens) that allows us to use the device. Â  




### Linux

Linux is the open-source core (kernel) of an operating system that acts as the fundamental software managing your computer's hardware and allowing other programs to run.

Advantages of Linux :

* **Free:** No cost to use or distribute.
* **Customizable:** Highly adaptable to user needs.
* **Secure:** Generally very resistant to malware.
* **Stable:** Known for running reliably for long periods.
* **Community Support:** Large online help network.
* **Many Versions:** Distributions for different users.
* **Great for Servers:** Industry standard for reliability.
* **Powerful Command Line:** Efficient for advanced tasks.
* **Low Resource Use:** Can run well on older hardware.

* **Hardware:** These are the physical components of your computer. Think of the **CPU** (the main processor, the "brain"), **RAM** (Random Access Memory, the short-term memory for active tasks), and **I/O** (Input/Output devices like your keyboard, mouse, screen, and storage). These are the tangible parts you can touch.

* **Kernel:** This is the core of the Linux operating system. It's the program that directly interacts with the hardware and manages all the system's resources. Think of it as the central manager that tells the CPU, RAM, and other hardware what to do.

* **Kernel Modules:** These are pieces of code that can be loaded into and unloaded from the Kernel as needed. They extend the functionality of the Kernel without requiring the entire system to be recompiled. Think of them as optional tools or extensions you can add to the central manager to handle specific tasks or hardware.

* **System Libraries:** These are collections of pre-written code that provide common functionalities needed by many different programs. Instead of every application having to write code for basic tasks (like displaying text on the screen or handling network connections), they can use these ready-made functions from the system libraries. This makes software development easier and more efficient.

* **System Softwares:** These are programs that manage and control the operating system itself. Examples include tools for managing files, users, processes, and system configurations. Think of them as the utilities that help you maintain and organize your computer.

* **User Process:** These are the applications that you, the user in Pakistan, directly run and interact with. This includes things like your web browser to access Pakistani websites, your word processor to write documents in Urdu or English, your media player to watch videos, and any other software you open and use.

* **User Utility:** These are smaller, often specialized programs that perform specific tasks for the user. Examples include command-line tools for managing files, configuring settings, or getting system information.

* **Compilers:** These are special programs that translate code written by programmers (in languages like C++, Python, etc.) into a language that the computer's CPU can understand and execute. They are essential tools for software development.

The diagram shows that the **Kernel** and **Kernel Modules** interact directly with the **Hardware**. The **System Libraries** provide support for the **System Softwares**, **User Processes**, **User Utilities**, and **Compilers**, enabling them to run on the Linux operating system.
