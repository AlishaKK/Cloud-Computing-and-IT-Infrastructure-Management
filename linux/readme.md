### What is an Operating System (OS)?


   **Operating System (OS) :** The core software that manages a computer's hardware and provides a platform for applications to run, making the device usable for users.

   **Why We Use an OS:**

* **Enables Hardware Functionality:** The OS tells the physical parts (screen, keyboard, etc.) how to work.
* **Platform for Apps:** It creates the environment needed for software like WhatsApp or web browsers to run.
* **Resource Management:** It efficiently organizes the computer's brain (CPU), memory (RAM), and storage.
* **User Interaction:** It provides the interface (icons, touchscreens) that allows us to use the device.

   important terms when comparing Windows OS and Linux:

| Term             | Windows OS                                     | Linux                                                | Short Comparison                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Kernel** | Proprietary, developed by Microsoft.           | Open source, with many different versions.           | Closed vs. Open core of the OS.                                   |
| **Distributions**| Primarily one main version (with editions).    | Many different versions (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora).      | Single main OS vs. many flavors.                                 |
| **Source Code** | Generally closed and not publicly accessible. | Openly available for anyone to view and modify.       | Closed vs. Open development model.                              |
| **Cost** | Typically requires purchasing a license.        | Often free to use (some enterprise versions may have costs). | Usually paid vs. often free.                                      |
| **Customization**| Limited compared to Linux.                      | Highly customizable at almost every level.           | Less flexible vs. very flexible.                                |
| **Security** | Historically a larger target for malware.        | Generally considered more secure out of the box.      | Historically more vulnerable vs. generally more secure.         |
| **Stability** | Has improved significantly over time.           | Known for high stability and uptime.                 | Generally stable vs. often very stable.                         |
| **Command Line** | Command Prompt (cmd.exe), PowerShell.          | Bash is common, with other shells available.         | Different command-line tools.                                   |
| **Package Mgmt.**| Traditionally manual installs (.exe, .msi).     | Uses package managers (apt, yum/dnf) for easy installs. | Manual installs vs. centralized software management.            |
| **User Base** | Largest global user base, common on desktops.  | Smaller desktop share, but dominant on servers.       | More common on desktops vs. dominant on servers.                 |
| **Hardware Comp.**| Broad compatibility, generally good driver support. | Generally good compatibility, but occasional driver issues can occur. | Generally wide support vs. mostly good support.                 |
| **Gaming** | Historically stronger support for AAA games.    | Improving support, but still often lags behind Windows. | Better game support vs. improving but often behind in AAA titles. |

**In short:** Windows is a widely used, proprietary OS known for its user-friendliness and game support, while Linux is an open-source, highly customizable OS favored for its security and server capabilities. The choice often depends on specific needs and technical comfort level in Pakistan or anywhere else.





### Linux

Linux is the open-source core (kernel) of an operating system that acts as the fundamental software managing your computer's hardware and allowing other programs to run.

Advantages of Linux :

* **Free:** No cost to use or distribute.
* **Customizable:** Highly adaptable to user needs.
* **Secure:** Generally very resistant to malware.
* **Stable:** Known for running reliably for long periods.
* **Community Support:** Large online help network.
* **Many Versions:** Distributions for different users.
* **Great for Servers:** Industry standard for reliability.
* **Powerful Command Line:** Efficient for advanced tasks.
* **Low Resource Use:** Can run well on older hardware.

* **Hardware:** These are the physical components of your computer. Think of the **CPU** (the main processor, the "brain"), **RAM** (Random Access Memory, the short-term memory for active tasks), and **I/O** (Input/Output devices like your keyboard, mouse, screen, and storage). These are the tangible parts you can touch.

* **Kernel:** This is the core of the Linux operating system. It's the program that directly interacts with the hardware and manages all the system's resources. Think of it as the central manager that tells the CPU, RAM, and other hardware what to do.

* **Kernel Modules:** These are pieces of code that can be loaded into and unloaded from the Kernel as needed. They extend the functionality of the Kernel without requiring the entire system to be recompiled. Think of them as optional tools or extensions you can add to the central manager to handle specific tasks or hardware.

* **System Libraries:** These are collections of pre-written code that provide common functionalities needed by many different programs. Instead of every application having to write code for basic tasks (like displaying text on the screen or handling network connections), they can use these ready-made functions from the system libraries. This makes software development easier and more efficient.

* **System Softwares:** These are programs that manage and control the operating system itself. Examples include tools for managing files, users, processes, and system configurations. Think of them as the utilities that help you maintain and organize your computer.

* **User Process:** These are the applications that you, the user in Pakistan, directly run and interact with. This includes things like your web browser to access Pakistani websites, your word processor to write documents in Urdu or English, your media player to watch videos, and any other software you open and use.

* **User Utility:** These are smaller, often specialized programs that perform specific tasks for the user. Examples include command-line tools for managing files, configuring settings, or getting system information.

* **Compilers:** These are special programs that translate code written by programmers (in languages like C++, Python, etc.) into a language that the computer's CPU can understand and execute. They are essential tools for software development.

The diagram shows that the **Kernel** and **Kernel Modules** interact directly with the **Hardware**. The **System Libraries** provide support for the **System Softwares**, **User Processes**, **User Utilities**, and **Compilers**, enabling them to run on the Linux operating system.
