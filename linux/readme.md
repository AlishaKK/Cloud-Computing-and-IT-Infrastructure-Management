### What is an Operating System (OS)?

Think of an Operating System (OS) as the main software on your computer or smartphone that acts like a manager between the hardware (the physical parts like the screen, keyboard, processor) and the applications (the programs you use, like WhatsApp, a web browser, or a game).  


Imagine you have a new smartphone. Without an OS, it's just a collection of electronic parts. The OS is the software that:


Makes the hardware work: It tells the screen how to display things, the keyboard how to register your typing, and the processor how to run programs.

Provides a platform for applications: It creates an environment where other software can run. Without an OS, apps wouldn't have a foundation to work on.

Manages resources: It organizes how the computer uses its resources like the processor (CPU), memory (RAM), and storage. It makes sure different programs don't interfere with each other and that resources are used efficiently.

Provides a user interface:
It gives you a way to interact with the computer, whether it's through icons and menus on a desktop (like Windows or macOS) or through touch gestures on a phone (like Android or iOS).   

Why do we use an Operating System?


We use an operating system because it makes using a computer or smartphone much easier and more efficient. Without it, you would have to directly communicate with the complex hardware components, which would be incredibly difficult for most people.   




### Linux

Linux is the open-source core (kernel) of an operating system that acts as the fundamental software managing your computer's hardware and allowing other programs to run.

* **Hardware:** These are the physical components of your computer. Think of the **CPU** (the main processor, the "brain"), **RAM** (Random Access Memory, the short-term memory for active tasks), and **I/O** (Input/Output devices like your keyboard, mouse, screen, and storage). These are the tangible parts you can touch.

* **Kernel:** This is the core of the Linux operating system. It's the program that directly interacts with the hardware and manages all the system's resources. Think of it as the central manager that tells the CPU, RAM, and other hardware what to do.

* **Kernel Modules:** These are pieces of code that can be loaded into and unloaded from the Kernel as needed. They extend the functionality of the Kernel without requiring the entire system to be recompiled. Think of them as optional tools or extensions you can add to the central manager to handle specific tasks or hardware.

* **System Libraries:** These are collections of pre-written code that provide common functionalities needed by many different programs. Instead of every application having to write code for basic tasks (like displaying text on the screen or handling network connections), they can use these ready-made functions from the system libraries. This makes software development easier and more efficient.

* **System Softwares:** These are programs that manage and control the operating system itself. Examples include tools for managing files, users, processes, and system configurations. Think of them as the utilities that help you maintain and organize your computer.

* **User Process:** These are the applications that you, the user in Pakistan, directly run and interact with. This includes things like your web browser to access Pakistani websites, your word processor to write documents in Urdu or English, your media player to watch videos, and any other software you open and use.

* **User Utility:** These are smaller, often specialized programs that perform specific tasks for the user. Examples include command-line tools for managing files, configuring settings, or getting system information.

* **Compilers:** These are special programs that translate code written by programmers (in languages like C++, Python, etc.) into a language that the computer's CPU can understand and execute. They are essential tools for software development.

The diagram shows that the **Kernel** and **Kernel Modules** interact directly with the **Hardware**. The **System Libraries** provide support for the **System Softwares**, **User Processes**, **User Utilities**, and **Compilers**, enabling them to run on the Linux operating system.
